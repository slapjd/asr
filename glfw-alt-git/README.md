# glfw-alt-git
Literally identical to glfw-git but it installs to a different folder. The idea is that if glfw-wayland-minecraft doesn't work you can point minecraft to this one instead (without using it by default).
Because it won't be used by anything by default (because it's in a folder) it therefore doesn't actually provide glfw system-wide in any capacity
